So, the quadratic expression
According to the question, the sum of roots is greatest and it is possible only when “<n? + 1) is minimum” and “minimum value of m? + 1 =1, when m =0”.

3. Given there are three boxes, each containing 10 balls labelled 1, 2, 3, ... , 10.
Now, one ball is randomly drawn from each boxes, and n, denote the label of the ball drawn from the ith box, (i =1,2,3).

All the numbers used are equal.
Then, the number of ways in which the balls can be chosen such that n, <n, <n, is same as selection of 3 different numbers from numbers {1, 2, 3, ... , 10} = "°C, =120.

Key Idea Use divisibility test of 11 and consider different situation according to given condition.
and number of four digit natural numbers less than 7000, that can be formed = 250
Since, the sum of given digits
O+1424+5+7+9=24
Let the six-digit number be abcdef and to be divisible by 11, so the difference of sum of odd placed digits and sum of even placed digits should be either 0 or a multiple of 11 means|(a+c+e) (b+d+ f)|should be either 0 or a multiple of 11.

Hence, possible case is a + c+ e=12=b+ d+ f (only) Now, Case I set {a,c, e} ={0,5, 7} and set {b, d, f} ={1, 2, 9} So, number of 6-digits numbers =(2 2!) (8!) =24 [- a can be selected in ways only either 5 or 7].
Now, Case I

Now, total ways of forming a team of 3 boys and 2 girls
Case II
="C, °C, =350
Set {a, c, e} ={1, 2,9} and set {b, d, f} ={0,5, 7} So, number of 6-digits numbers =3! 3!=36 So, total number of 6-digits numbers = 24 + 36
=60
But, if two specific boys are in team, then number of ways = °C, °C, =50
Required ways, i.e. the ways in which two specific boys are not in the same team =350 50 =300.
Since there are 8 males and 5 females. Out of these 13 members committee of 11 members is to be formed.

Set Pcan be chosen in 2” ways, similarly set @ can be chosen in 2” ways.
P and Q can be chosen in (2”)(2”) = 4” ways.
Suppose, P contains r elements, where r varies from 0 to n. Then, Pcan be chosen in "C,, ways, for 0 to be disjoint from A, it should be chosen from the set of all subsets of set consisting of remaining (nr) elements. This can be done in 2” ” ways.
P and Qcan be chosen in "C,, 2” " ways.

But Statement II is true as sin” xis periodic with period #.
10. It gives three cases
Case I When f(x) =1is true.
In this case, remaining two are false.
f(y)=1 and f@)=2
This means x and y have the same image, so f(x) is not an injective, which is a contradiction.
Case II When f(y) f 1is true.
If f(y) 71 is true, then the remaining statements are false.
.
Case III When f(z) 2 is true.
If f(z) t 2 is true, then remaining statements are If f(x) Tland f(y)=1 But f is injective. Thus, we have f(x) =2, f(y) =1 and f(z) =3 Hence, fid)=y Since, fis an even function, then f( x)=f(x%), x ( 5,5) Given , fw=f xe x+2 x+1 fCx=f a) x+1 f(a=f 12D Taking f | on both sides, we get — xt x42 x +Qx= x41 x” 38x+1=0 13 t 9 4345 2 2 Again, fw=f xe x+2 fC ay=p X24 x+2 Taking f | on both sides, we get xt1 x= —— x+2 x’ +3x+1=0 349 4 3+ 65 2 2 +345 x= Therefore, four values of x are fe fC x)= f@) fe fC x)=

Since, limit exist and equal to 5 and denominator is zero at x=1,so numerator x” ax+ b should be zero at x=1,
So 1 a+b=0 a=1+b .. (ii)

Hence, for a = Oand b =5, f(x)is not continuous at x =3
f(x) cannot be continuous for any values of a and b.

8. The function f(x) =tanx is not defined at x=, so 2
f(x) is not continuous on (0, 4).

Also, xsin#x becomes negative and numerically less than 1 when x is slightly greater than 1 and so by definition of [x].
f(x) =[xsin4x]= 1,whenl<x<1+h
Thus, f(x) is constant and equal to 0 in the closed interval [-1, 1] and so f(x) is continuous and differentiable in the open interval (-1, 1).
At x=1, f(x) is discontinuous, since jim (l hjy=0

The curve is symmetrical about X-axis.
Thus, we have that there must be some x, such that f(x,,) =2.
Thus, y = mxintersects this closed curve for all values of m.

Hints & Solutions
Topic1 Equation of Circle
1. Itis given that the circle touches the X-axis at (3, 0) and making an intercept of 8 on the Y-axis.
3. Let the foot of perpendicular be P(h, k). Then, the slope of line OP = fk h


-: Line AB is perpendicular to line OP, so slope of line
Let the radius of the circle is ‘r’, then the coordinates of centre of circle are (3, r).
From the figure, we have
AB= ,
[- product of slopes of two perpendicular lines is (
1)]
CM =3,
CA = radius =r and AM = BM = 2 =4 Then, r?=CM?+ AM? =9+ 16=25 r=+5
CA = radius =r
Now, the equation of circle having centre (8,+5) and radius = 5 is
Now, the equation of line ABis
h y k= % (@ h) x + y hx+ ky =h? +k? or + — = 1 h?+k? P+ k? h k 2, 42 2, 42 So, point A hitk ,0 andB 0,2 +k k
(x 8)? + (y +5)? =25
Now, from the options (3, 10) satisfy the equation of circle
-: @AOB is a right angled triangle, so AB is one of the diameter of the circle having radius R (given).
(x 3)? +(y 5)? =25
2. Given vertices of ZAOP are O(0,0) and A(0, 1)
Let the coordinates of point P are (x, y).
Clearly, perimeter = OA + AP + OP =4 (given)

On replacing h by x and k by y, we get
(+ yy? =4RPx’y?,
which is the required locus.
4, Given equation of circle is x7+ y* 6x+8y 103 =0, which can be written as(x 3)? + (y+ 4)? = 128 = (8/2)?
[squaring both sides]
1 2y=9 6x74 6,/x7 + y? =2y4+8 3x24 y= y44 9(x? + 9) = (y+ 4)? 9x7 + Oy" = y? + By +16 9x7 + 8y? 8y=16 Thus, the locus of point P(x, y) is 9x7 + 8y? 8y=16 [squaring both sides]
Centre = (8, 4) and radius = 8/2
Now, according to given information, we have the following figure.

5. Clearly, centre of the circumscribed circle is the centroid (G) of the equilateral triangle ABC.
[- in an equilateral triangle circumcentre and centroid coincide]

Also, we know that ZAGB BGC CGA [by SAS congruence rule] ar(@ABC) =3 ar(ZAGB) =3 r’sin 120Y [- area of triangle = absin ( C)] - ar(QABC) =27,/3 [given] 32 38 =27./3 2 2 B [sin 120Y=sin (180Y 60Y) =sin 60Y= a) r=4 9 r=6 Now, radius of circle, r=Je+f? c 6=./25+36 c [- in the given equation of circle 2g = 10

6. Key idea Orthocentre, centroid and circumcentre are collinear and centroid divide orthocentre and circumcentre in 2:1 ratio.
We have orthocentre and centroid of a triangle be A( 3,5) and B@, 3) respectively and C circumcentre.

Since, SA, = SA,, OSA, Az is an equilateral triangle.
The circle with centre at C, is a circle inscribed in the @SA, Ap. Therefore, centre C, is centroid of @SA, Ap. This, C, divides SM in the ratio 2 : 1. Therefore, coordinates of C, are ( 4/3,0) and its radius =C,M =1/3

tan A+ tan B+ tan C =3 tan 60Y= 34/3 Conversely assume that,

tan A+tanB = tanC+ tan Atan BtanC tan A+ tan B+ tan C =tan A tan B tan C =3./3 None of the tan A, tan B, tan C can be negative

Since, tan (B/2) and tan (C/2) are rational, hence tan (A/2)is a rational.

number, sin A is a rational. Similarly, sin B and sin C are. Thus, a, sin A, sin B, sin C are rational, therefore Gi) Gil).
Again, a, sin A, sin B, sin C are rational.
By the sine rule,
a b c sn A sinB sinC asin B asin C = and c= sin A sin A b
Since a, sin A, sin B and sin C are rational,
Hence, b and c are also rational.
Also, O= ; bcsin A
As b, c and sin A are rational, so triangle is rational number. Therefore, a, b, cand triangle are rational.

12. (30) Given that, no two persons sitting adjacent in circular arrangement, have hats of same colour. So, only possible combination due to circular arrangement is 2+ 2+ 1.
So, there are following three cases of selecting hats are
2R + 2B + 1G or 2B + 2G + Ror 2G + 2R + 1B.
To distribute these 5 hats first we will select a person which we can done in °C, ways and distribute that hat which is one of it’s colour. And, now the remaining four hats can be distributed in ane, 8 two ways.
